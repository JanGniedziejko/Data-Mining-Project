### BREWER’S FRIEND BEER RECIPES [[Dataset](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1HLpOzRxqcbKK1yoMV07QNoNilzQSOt6AkGpC2Xg9kvo/edit?gid=99896485#gid=99896485)]

### The code involves:
- **Data Manipulation & Preprocessing:** Used pandas for data loading, cleaning, and transformations (handling missing values, standardizing features, encoding categorical variables)
- **Classification Methods:** Applied multiple classification algorithms including Decision Tree, Random Forest, KNN, and Logistic Regression.
- **Data Visualization:** Used matplotlib and seaborn for plotting value ranges, data distributions, and missing data patterns.
- **Feature Engineering:** Converted nominal to numerical values and applied z-score standardization.


## First Part: Understanding the Problem and the Data
In the first stage, we focus on getting to know the dataset and setting clear goals for what we want to achieve. This includes:

- **Dataset Overview:** A general description of the dataset, including where it comes from, its format, and basic details like the number of samples.
- **Goals for the Project:** What we aim to achieve through data mining and how we’ll measure success.
- **Dataset Details:** A breakdown of the attributes (like names, types, and units of measurement) and whether there are any special values.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis:**
  - Looking at how values are distributed across attributes.
  - Checking for relationships or correlations between different attributes.
  - Noting any early insights from the dataset.
- **Data Quality Check:**
  - Identifying missing values, outliers, and strange or unknown entries.
  - Overall assessment of data quality.
- **Goal Review:** After understanding the data better, we may need to adjust or confirm our project goals.

## Second Part: Preparing the Data and Building Models
In this stage, we clean up the data and build models to explore our goals further. This includes:

- **Quick Dataset Review:** A brief description of the dataset and a recap of our goals.
- **Planning the Model:**
  - Deciding on the type of task (e.g., classification, clustering), the algorithm we’ll use, and how we’ll evaluate its success.
- **Preparing the Data:**
  - Handling missing values and checking if any data needs to be normalized.
  - Deciding if we should use a subset of the data or add more.
  - Converting data types (e.g., changing text to numbers) based on the model requirements.
- **Building the Model:**
  - Choosing the algorithm’s settings, running the model, and analyzing the results (e.g., examining a decision tree or cluster centers).
  - Evaluating how well the model performs.
- **Experimenting with the Model:**
  - Trying different subsets of data or attributes, tweaking parameters, and testing other algorithms.
  - Observing how these changes impact the model’s performance.
